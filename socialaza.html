			 			<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
			 			<br><p>How might we enable people to find social companions for activities and events of their interest?</p>
			 			<h2>Problem Description</h2>
			 			<br><p>Humans are social animals, but not everyone has the same preferences when it comes to certain activities and events. Sometimes, you want to go see a movie which none of your friends want to see. You want to try that new vegan restaurant but your friends aren't into vegan food. With this in mind, we wanted to create an app that makes it easier for people to find companions for activities based on common interests. </p>

				 		<h2>Project Details</h2>
			 			<br><p><b>Duration:</b> 
				 		<br>September 2017 - December 2017</p>
				 		<p><b>Role:</b>
				 		<br>UX Designer, Front-End Developer</p>
				 		<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
				 		<br><ul>
				 			<li>Social computing systems need to take into account issues with privacy, user security, anonymity and accountability which can have serious implications for the design of the product.</li>
				 			<li>Time is a crucial resources while shipping an end-to-end product. An MVP with limited features is better than no product at all.</li>

			 	<div class="col-12">
				 	<div class="projectcontent">
					 	<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
					 	<p>Socialaza is a social app which helps people to find activities and events posted by people in the area. We use Facebook credentials to authenticate users to the app and users only see activities posted by their second and third degree Facebook connections.</p>

					 	<h2>Process</h2>
					 	<h3>Competitive research</h3>
					 	<p>We conducted secondary research to find similar applications that exist in this space. Of the 13 applications we examined, most were in the travel domain, offering local tour guides for tourists. A few applications existed in the movies/workout domains, but they lacked several important features which make a good social app.</p>
					 	<h3>Survey and User Interviews</h3>
					 	<p>The aim of the survey was to understand attitudes towards going for certain activities with people they don't know. We asked people several questions about their willingness to go for certain activities with unknown persons.
					 		<h4>SURVEY INSIGHTS</h4>
					 		<ul>
					 			<li>People are comfortable with unknown persons showing them around the city.</li>
					 			<li>The average willingness for most activities was around 3 on a 5 point scale, but certain activities like shopping and workouts stood out as many participants were hesitant to do these with strangers.</li>
					 			<li>Activities involving lesser social interaction between companions were preferred over the others</li>
					 		</ul>
					 	</p>
					 	<p>We also conducted in-depth interviews with six participants to learn more about people's preferences towards certain activities and the reasons behind them. We also wanted to understand users' privacy and security concerns while using this app. </p>

					<div class="projectcontent">
						<h4>INTERVIEW INSIGHTS</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Activities like shopping and buying groceries revolve around personal choice and people are uncomfortable doing these with strangers.</li>
							<li>People are most comfortable being shown around the city by a stranger, but are also concerned about the person's credentials.</li>
							<li>Similarly, credentials matter for adventure sports as people feel safer with someone experienced.</li>
							<li>Food preferences and restrictions might make it hard to find companions to go to restaurants with.</li>
						</ul>

					 	<h3>Concept Refinement</h3>
					 	<p>From our user research, we narrowed down our initial scope and focused on seven different types of activities that research participants had expressed the most interest in. We also spent time refining features like matching people based on interest rather than letting them select and creating a review system rather than rating people.</p>

				 		<h3>Iterative Design</h3>
				 		<p>We then iterated on the design through sketches and wireframes and low fidelity prototypes. At each stage, we evaluated the design based on user research insights and feedback received from peers, bringing the design back to the problem we were trying to solve.</p>

				 			<li>Get matched with people based on your profile and interests, meet new people and have a good time.</li>
				 			<li>Give cool badges to your companions and let them know you enjoyed their company.</li>

				 		<h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
				 		<p>We used Google's Material Design guidelines to create visual assets of our high fidelity prototype. Each activity type is color-coded, and has a default image associated with it. We created a badge system for users to leave reviews for their companions.</p>

						<h3>Implementation</h3>
				 		<p>Being a social computing application, we needed to think about the scalability and distributed nature of the system. Social computing applications have variable levels of engagement and user behaviors, which had to be taken into account during both design and implementation.</p>
				 		<p>To implement this project as an end-to-end system, we created an MVP product using the Flask web framework and SQLite as the database engine. We implemented key features of the app, like creating a new activity, editing user profile. We also implemented Facebook login using OAuth.</p>
				 		<p>To make the functional prototype more app-like, we tweaked the CSS so that the pages would load in a mobile configuration.</p>
