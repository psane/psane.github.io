		 			<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		 			<p>How can we make packing and trip-planning easier and alleviate stress associated with taking a trip?</p>
		 			<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		 			<p>Packing and planning a trip can be very stressful, and can take away from the excitement of going away on a vacation. Knowing what to bring and making sure that they have everything they need, is a very daunting task that may travellers are apprehensive about. Travelers employ various methods to make sure they pack appropriately, but none of these methods are foolproof and inevitably, something gets left behind.</p>
		 			<p>We wanted to address this problem by creating a packing system that takes the stress out of trip planning.</p>

			 		<h2>Project Details</h2>
			 		<p><b>Duration:</b> 
			 		<br>Sept 2017 - December 2017</p>
			 		<p><b>Role:</b>
			 		<br>User Researcher, Prototyping Engineer</p>
			 		<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
			 		<ul>
			 			<li>I learned new UX research methods like experience prototyping, diary study and cultural probes.</li>
			 			<li>Designing for emerging mobile and context-aware technologies has its own set of challenges. Technology behind the design may not be available comercially, or is prohibitively expensive. Futuristic design concepts need to be backed by technological feasibility.</li>

				 	<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
				 	<p>Our product is a smart packing aid that uses the Internet of Things (IoT) to make packing stress-free and simple. Our product consists of two parts: a tracking hub located in the suitcase and several stickers which can be applied to various objects. The hub keeps track of the &ldquo;stickered" items and reminds the user to pack items they have forgotten.</p>

				<div class="projectcontent">
				 	<h2>Process</h2>
				 	<p>After initial user research, we conceptualized a product which was validated with users multiple times and reiterated the design based on feedback. We also focused a great deal on the technology we would use to prototype the product, not constraining ourselves to technology currently available commercially.</p>
				 	<h3>Observations/Interviews</h3>
				 	<p>We conducted informal interviews with 5 participants who shared their recent packing experiences and the major breakdowns that occurred during their trips. We also conducted observation sessions with 2 participants as they were packing for a trip.</p>
				 	<h4>INSIGHTS</h4>
				 	<ul>
				 		<li>Forgetting to pack essential items brings about feelings of regret and disappointment which negatively affects the overall trip experience.</li>
				 		<li>Travelers are most stressed moments before leaving the house, worrying if they have forgotten something.</li>
				 		<li>Routine items that are used right before leaving, are often the most forgotten.</li>
				 	</ul>
				 	<h3>Diary Study</h3>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-12">
				<div class="projectcontent">
					<p>We conducted a diary study with three participants who recorded their interactions with their luggage for five days - three days before their trips when they were packing and during the first two days of their trip.</p>

			 		<h3>Experience Prototyping</h3>
			 		<p>We selected five scenarios which would help us understand how the system would integrate into the user's lives and learn if it would add value to the user's packing process. We recruited five participants to enact these scenarios and observe them as they did so. After enacting the scenarios, we debriefed with the participants, asking them for their impressions about the concept and the product mockups. We also asked participants how autonomous they expected the system to be, how intrusive they thought the system was, and if they would be comfortable using the system in everyday life.</p>

			 		<h3>IoT Prototyping</h3>
		 			<p>To demonstrate the working of the product, we created a prototype using Bluetooth sensors and buzzers. Using the <a href="appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a>, we created a sample Android application which used the phone's Bluetooth to communicate with several <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-bluefruit-le/overview">Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE</a> which represented &ldquo;stickered" items. The functional prototype did not include the implementation of the tracking hub due to time constraints, but in the commercial product, the tracking hub placed inside the suitcase would automatically check for missing items when the suitcase lid is closed, and notify the user of items they have not packed.</p>

			 	</div>
			 </div>
			 <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-12">
			 	<div class="projectcontent">
			 		<p>We spent a significant amount of time on the sticker design. During our user research, participants voiced that they would not want clunky stickers on items they use every day. They were also concerned about the durability of the stickers as everyday items tend to see rough use. Hence, we designed the stickers to look elegant and be long-lasting. The stickers would be paper-thin, like conventional stickers, but also have electronic components embedded in them. We envision that in the near future, such material will be invented, which would make this design possible. </p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-12">
				<div class="projectcontent">
					<h3>UI Design</h3>
					<p>We also created mockups for the accompanying TravelSmart app using Sketch and InVision. The app would facilitate interaction with the stickers and tracking hub, and allow users to find items easily. Through the app, users can create custom stickers and get notified when they have forgotten to pack an item.</p>
